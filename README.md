# What is this fork?
Fork of CamxxCore/ScriptCamTool with some additional features:
- Bypass node limit when setting camera path.
- Allow saving and loading of path from a file.

# Why?
This work started as part of my thesis, where I utilised a deep-learning model to improve the quality of CG renders towards photorealism. This mod was used to help gather synthetic data for training purposes.
